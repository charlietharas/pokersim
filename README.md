# pokersim
Poker simulator and lesson plan for 9th grade intro to CS.

## reflections from running this lesson during the 2022 Fall semester
- The final round of games will need to be run in an environment with higher processing power, still takes ~40 mins at 1,000 games per permutation
- **Important**: this version of poker significantly favors calls even after changes made to the weight system. To ensure fair games of poker in later rounds, the simulation should be updated to allow for returning to previous players after raises.
